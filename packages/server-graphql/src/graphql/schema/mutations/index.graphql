# Define GraphQL mutations

  runCompleted(runs: [RunRecordInput!]!): [ID!]!

  # Run select is a message operation
  # Since it just triggers a message it returns null, but GQL requires return
  # datad. To deal with this we just allow it to be nullable here by excluding !
  selectRun(run: RunSelectInput!): Boolean

  # Start run is a create operation and returns the created run's ID
  startRun(run: RunRecordInput!): ID!

  # Run finish is an update operation and simply returns the number of rows affected.
