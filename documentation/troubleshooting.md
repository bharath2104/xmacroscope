# Troubleshooting

## Node version
If you're running in to any issues installing the project, you're likely running the wrong `Node` version.

Ensure that you're using the supported `Node` and `npm` versions spelled out in the [project requirements](https://github.com/cns-iu/xmacroscope/blob/master/documentation/installation.md#requirements).

If you're running the wrong `Node` or `npm` versions:
 - you may see an error about sqlite not being installed.
 - you may have difficulty installing the project on the Windows operating system.
