The xMacroscope project will develop a rapid-prototyping research and exhibit design platform for use in the science museum environment.
 
The xMacroscope provides a way for museum visitors to build and interpret visualizations that use data generated by the visitors during their exhibit experience. 
The integration of data gathered via motion sensors, combined with an easy-to-use interface that guides visitors in building various types of data visualizations using that sensor data, 
will provide a novel platform for conducting research on the efficacy of different methods for improving data visualization literacy.

*This project is a work in progress, under active development. It is not ready for a production deployment yet.*
